## Colliding Objects

This project was more difficult than I anticipated. This was mainly due to my misunderstanding of the rotate() function. Using this without a push/pop created a confusing outcome, and missing pieces. My objects were bouncing around off of nothing, and this vexed me for some time. The frustrating thing, was I ran into this mistake before in Homework 08. With some help, and lots of review, I was able to accomplish the bouncing, colliding objects I was after.

One failure in this process, I attempted to learn how to create rectangular collision boxes, instead of the circular ones we have implemented thus far. Eventually, after hours of troubleshooting, google-ing, and re-coding. I gave up. This asteroids environment is my second version of this assignment.
